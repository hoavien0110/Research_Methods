test_pid_699,"34/M - Sharing my story. Freedom from severe depression! : Hello everybody. I just wanted to share my personal experience with major depression in the hopes that I may provide some inspiration, motivation to those that are struggling! This will be long, I would prefer not to summarize things!
For nearly two decades, I had major depressive disorder - I felt completely overwhelmed by my depression. It ate up all my mental (and physical) energy, like a vampire within my own mind that I felt I couldn't get rid of. This affected my self-worth, lowered my self-image, and made me feel ashamed to interact with other people, because I was ashamed of myself, and I didn't want anybody to see that part of me. Therefore, I spent a lot of time isolating myself from others and have had very few close friends that I felt I could be truly honest with.
I saw numerous counselors, psychiatrists, life coaches, psychoanalysts, you name it. I tried 12 different medications, and I even had 52 neurofeedback sessions spread out across 4 months. I was determined to become free, to live a better life. During those nearly two decades, I would try a new therapist, or new medication, or new workout routine, or new diet - and in the beginning, it wouldn't work out the way I expected. Often, I would find that most things just ""covered up"" the depression, but didn't help permanently dissolve it. This led to a (seemingly) never-ending cycle of building the courage to not lose hope, try something new to treat the depression, become discouraged or disillusioned that it wasn't working, then fall back into feeling victimized by my depression and retreating into social isolation, using drugs, masturbation, unhealthy food and other distractions as a placeholder for my sadness.
As I continued trying new treatments for the depression, even if it didn't work out the way I anticipated, with each new go,  I was unconsciously feeding energy to a very distant part of myself - a self that had the will to be more, to feel and share joy with others. It was the pure, innocent and loving part of myself that had been buried by the momentum of nearly two decades of negative beliefs, thoughts and physical acts. Ultimately, in choosing to keep going and not give up, I was also choosing to acknowledge and listen to this part of my self. As a result, I was gradually ""chipping away"" at the depression - making it more and more manageable, and less pervasive in my mind. Although again, I wasn't conscious of this at the time.
I just want to let anyone reading this know that I GENUINELY felt for the longest time that I was going to be depressed forever. I couldn't see a way out and thought of killing myself nearly every day of my life. And yet - as I am typing this, I am experiencing more mental freedom then I could have ever imagined. I would not be experiencing this if I had given up. I chose to keep going, even though I was afraid that I would fail again and become even more discouraged. Eventually, I found the right therapist, the right medication, I discovered neurofeedback, and things began to ""click"" for me. It was NOT an instant process, again it was gradual.
I can see now that my depression was just like a computer program that was projecting the same negative thoughts, beliefs into my mind. I realized that any specific belief or thought that REPEATS in my mind is NOT me - the true being that I am is a creative being. I also realized that how I feel at any given time is directly correlated with whether or not I have allowed these negative programs into my mind. But I CAN separate myself from these thoughts - I can detach myself from these thoughts, I do NOT have to let these thoughts in. I can let them die, until the depression machine loses its stored energy, and thus loses its power over my mind and how I feel.
Once I started becoming more and more conscious of this - I could detect the negative thoughts in my mind as they appear, and rather than being passive and allowing them in, or choosing to identify myself with these thoughts, I could go into a neutral state and instead choose to reject them. Then, I could more easily tap into my positive, loving, optimistic self. It's a lot like changing the channel to better one on a TV, except in my mind.  
Although I am still struggling from time to time, the depression is WAY less prominent, and I have so much more hope and faith that things will get better. And if I can do it - considering how hopeless I used to think things were, feeling like I was in a black hole of despair with no escape, and how many mistakes I have made that fed the depression - then I truly believe that everybody has the capacity to do it. It's a process, of course... but the journey of a hundred miles begins with the first step!",moderate,severe,severe,severe
test_pid_1298,"Depression hitting’ harder than usual : Feeling worthless in this Chili’s tonight...
I’m unemployed and technically living at home, my entire life has felt like a series of chaos and trouble organizing anything to get anywhere. Woke up this afternoon depressed as hell about my shorty childhood, not the worst my heart goes out to others that have had that and wish them all the love and support to love and move and keep loving and moving. Intimacy is so hard I haven’t been in a real relationship before. I felt I held back all my life. College was supposed to be the years you don’t and even that I felt I had to restrict myself for structure that ended up in me just cha going my major a lot and graduating with less than a 3.0 gpa. I have no friends do either, I never felt I had any that likes me at all in the past. A lot of suppressing sexuality and self hating that changed when I hit 20, but felt I regressed back again to those dark moments of loneliness. Got bullied by a group of boys for being a lesbian before realizing I was later on all throughout middle school and had friends turn on me back then too. Family has been toxic and overly controlling and restrictive. Getting fired from shorty commission jobs and yelled at even though I was the only one to show up and working under the tables jobs between 13 to 23. I don’t have a car, I have a degree but debt. I don’t get much financial support, regret not loving out earlier and toxic family trying to force codependence. Regret not having more fun and things from growing up and falling in love more. Wanting to work in journalism and nonprofit as a part of committee maybe a head or spokesperson or even just a member. Regretting not working more and doing more internships and clubs in college and working harder to make closer lasting friends. I close myself off way too much and am doing so more and more to my detriment. I feel my stomach closing in thinking of bad memories and how worthless I feel it’s so hard. I just feel so behind in everything and felt all my attempts at everything went wrong and I’m just here I’m a pit.

Ok so over the past year, I have isolated myself to the point where when I’m with my friends, I feel like they’re wondering why I’m even there because I haven’t hung out with them in so long. I rarely eat, and will be lucky if I manage to get 1000 calories a day. I used to love working out, going 6 days a week but I don’t care anymore and haven’t been in months. I’m an insomniac (it’s 4am as I’m writing this) and usually can’t get out of bed until 1pm.

test_pid_2315,"Becoming Independent : Lately i've been very depressed about the idea of becoming independent and growing to be an adult. Im 17 and I'm suppose to gradate this year, but never have this feeling of anxiousness  and fear not *dwell* on me. growing up i was very sheltered and till this day i still consider myself sheltered. I've never really gone out and seen the world, I've only been informed of the dangers by my mom because luckily she got to see it herself. And while i am so pleased that i was told about those dangers unlike some people who've been sheltered, it feels as though i cannot entirely accept that fact. I'm a very sensitive person and I dont even know how to defend myself. throughout my years of schooling, I've always been bullied and too afraid to defend myself, I don't know where this trait of mine came from because I consider both of my parents to be very guarded and defensive. I hate the fact that I haven't developed that side to me. another thing about me is that I'm almost like a baby inside. Can't handle too much pressure. At home i act like a little kid but once i step foot into the outdoors, there's like this mask that comes upon me out of nowhere, and I feel as though i have to behave as this sophisticated being. idk how to act like myself in public. im always hiding my true feelings because im afraid of judgment. the person that people have perceived me to be is not at all how i perceive myself. I'm not defensive, i'm not assertive, and i don't even know who i am. I'm a sensitive child inside who on the outside is looked to be something im not. and i honestly hate it. today I asked a woman if i could borrow her phone and she gave me a rude stare, as though she was disgusted with me and my overall presence. On the outside I looked like i couldn't care less that she behaved that way towards me, but in reality i was going to cry my eyes out. little things really hurt me and it sucks that im that way. I really wish i was this bold person who could handle a kick in the ass,but I can't handle anything and it makes me worry to death about the future. I've been very depressed about the idea of being on my own and getting out into the real world, because this world is so cruel and i don't think i could possibly handle it. I feel like im too sensitive in this world and everyone runs over me. People tell me im independent. and of course that's because of my reputation of being an introvert. I like being alone but some if it has to simply do with not being judged or hurt, or not being accepted or whatever but i'll say this now. I am not independent and that's just the truth. I thought i was independent all these years but i feel as though im not. I can barley shop without freaking out because im so worried about what other people think of me. I can hardly order food alone. Talking on the phone and making important calls is an issue for me. Im so tired of people assuming im just this serious person who has their shit together because honestly that aint even me.

-Never had much hope finding a gf
-I feel everything in such a raw way that theres no filter
-Hard for me to connect with people in the first place, even harder to genuinely vibe with them

-Went on 3 dates but feelings were overly intense already
-Everything was perfect
-Im pretty sure i was the one that messed up, can never know for sure
-Think she got scared because her last relationship ended badly
-Ended abrubtly
-Sent me into deep spiralling depression where i felt like i was dying, sobbing endlessly everyday, trying to get ""advice"" from every person i talked to or even never had before, just trying to get something that would make me feel any better or maybe it was just to vent

Its been years, i just dont know what to do at this point. Do you guys ever forget your first TRUE love, something  you feel like you might never have again just from how rare it was to happen in the first place? It was truly like seeing a unicorn, im not exagerating. Only thing thats kept me going is me trying to convince myself that ill be able to find someone like that again, no matter how many times i say it, i never fully believe myself although i want to. I also like to think that theres another dimension out there where it worked with me and her, that at least one of me is happy.
So thats where im at right now. Whenever i think of her i end up ruining my day and the next day at least, just opening up the wound and never having it fully heal. I know at least that i just wasnt ready to have a relationship with someone so good and i definitely, unfortunately, had to learn from it but i made sure of it i learned everything i could. Not gonna go through months of crying like a bitch for nothing.
I honestly dont know where im going with this, if anyone wants to relate and write there experiences, write any sort of advice, or just say ""same man, i feel you"", please do.

test_pid_1927,"A strange Depression. : This is a throwaway. I've much on my shoulders, I just need to get it off. And I have nobody else. I mean, NOBODY. Very first post, please be reasonable.
I've been battling this since I was 12. Folks died within a month or two apart. I was sent to live with my guardian. I have since been lost, wandering the world in search of a purpose. I am overweight, not athletic. Not good at much. I know a lot about animals though, they were always something I could let my mind delve into. I'd dream of filming all the animals across the globe. But I knew it wouldn't happen. I tend to be pessimistic. Forgive me. My guardian who raised me basically tried their best,  know they did. But they were just too old and out of the ""parenting"" game to really do much. So I was left with NO guidance. No way to determine who I'd be. Sure I had family who had taken me out for fun nights at dinners, sleepovers with cousins. The usual. But back then, it seemed to be a daze of things. I felt the world spinning around me and my little bubble, where I wouldn't escape, but I could see everything taking shape around me.
I wrote a lot, I cried, A LOT. I stayed hidden away a lot. I just tried to be happy for everyone else, because I didn't want to burden them. I went through ALL types of counseling. It seemed to dull the pain from time to time. In my adult life, I ran rampant. I didn't do drugs other than smoke some pot which helped me with anxiety. I didn't have any children (still don't). I've been married for almost 5 years to someone who has helped so much but also has issues of their own which tend to shake me. I feel like a shaken soul. Just spinning around the earth, hearing, seeing, smelling and observing all the lives amongst me. I've not genuinely given up, but I certainly have lost much hope. I do believe in God, but it's not some crazy church bullshit. I believe we are created to serve a purpose. And I don't blame God because of free will. We all have obstacles and how we choose to deal with them is what helps define us and define our character (please don't bash, I wouldn't dream of harming someone else for their beliefs. I think you should be free to explore any beliefs you should choose. That is our choice)
I'm just in this whirlwind of struggle, anger, numbness to an extent. I've thought about dying, but I don't want to till it's my body's natural time. Till I run my clock out. I couldn't dream of taking my life because there is so much beauty I do get to see, and I enjoy the happiness of others. It's about what drives me. 
But down inside, into the very core is pain. Tears, anger, hatred, and self-loathing. I am trying to fight it each day with positivity but it is never enough. I  just want to feel normal. If there is such a thing...

I worry my personality puts off everyone but people who’re so outgoing they already have somebody. I tell my therapist all the time that I don’t feel good enough for what I deserve. 
I guess if I need to hear anything, it’s that she’s out there, that there are girls out there who would really genuinely love me. My therapist tells me I need to meet a girl who’s very open minded, and loves to learn. It’s just like I said, I hope I’m not looking for more than I can ever dream of getting.
I think I’m worth it, and lately, it’s been better. Today was rough though.",severe,moderate,moderate,moderate
test_pid_2540,"I just seem to be loosing the will to care anymore : So long story short I've been struggling with  depression and anixety for a while now and over the last few months it's been spiking and I just feel like shit all the time, I hate a lot of things now and find myself wanting to just be alone and things that normally bring joy to people aren't doing it for me anymore. My family relationship isn't the best and they are all the way down in Georgia (I'm in Wisconsin) I hate where I live, I hate other people my age, I hate being gay, I hate my looks, hate my job, dentist told me out of the blue I have gum diease so that's fucking great even tho I brush my fucking teeth, mind you I'm only 23, I hate my job, can't tell real from fake friends, and overall I'm just not happy with my life. On paper I should be happy since I have my own luxury apartment. Nice car, good work ethic, can usually travel a few times a year, eat healthy and just seem like the nicest guy ever. But inside I just feel like shit. I honestly don't even feel 23 as most of those guys get to fuck around and not be full time adults but me? Nah I dont get that luxury. I know many people worse than me yet nothing bad ever happens to them or at the very least they have people around that give a shit about them.

I understand that a lot of people don't know what they're getting into, but you know what? Sitting there and using me as a lightning rod for all your problems and then trying to ditch me the second I need to talk or going as far as burning a bridge between our friendship because I had an episode around you and seeked ypur comfort, is ridiculous.
So to the ""friend: who just did this to me, who said, ""Sorry for ditching you the other day.."" - You didn't just ditch me, you ran for the hills, then came back when I was in a better place. I was there for you every time you needed me and when I have an episode, on the fence about ending my life and just needing someone to hear me and you run, that's just fucked up. 
You know that I'm not dangerous, that I wouldn't hurt you or anyone else. I wasn't screaming, I was crying and dud nothing but sit in bed and cry all day. So I don't know why you felt the need to ditch me.

test_pid_984,"I wont last much longer if this doesnt stop : The only thing i want to do is cry, drink and sleep. Nobody has ever tried to help me even though ive basically started crying in front them trying to explain how i feel. Including my mother. 
Im currently in my bed crying. Crying because i dont think my parents care. Crying because my friends (or atleast the people i usually call friends, im pretty certain they dont see me the same way) doesnt seem to care. Crying because my school performance is at an all time low, mainly because i either dont have enough energy to go to school or focus when im actually there. 
As i said, i dont think my ""friends"" even see me as a friend, nor do i matter to them. Atleast not as much as they do to me. I know im just a second choice. Im the person they talk to when their other better friends are busy. Nobody would choose to be with me if they had someone else there, and not ""invite"" me either. 
My mom said she wanted to help when i talked to her about how i feel (which i have three times), but she hasnt done shit. Actually she told me she forgot about it. Every. Single. Time. I would never forget if my child wouldve told me about their troubles. Fuck her. Fuck everything.

test_pid_2924,"People with depression annoy me (pls read) : K I've said this before to people without any means to ""troll"" or whatnot. I just want to express my opinion but people don't want to accept my opinion or attempt to discuss it with me, really. Honestly I feel like if I'm open enough to my own idea that goes against 99% of what society says, I can be open to someone changing my mind/bringing info to alter my perspective.
So maybe the title is misleading. Maybe it isn't. I can't really tell but what I know is that I honestly can't stand hearing all these sob stories from people with depression....or what I like to say...""depression."" See I do believe mental illness is a thing. It's not anything set in stone because sure you can have underdeveloped parts of your brain and shit, but its all just a cluster of symptoms that will never be set in stone because all these diagnosis are made up just like anything else in the world, really. But anyway
Im sure we've all heard, or have all complained about, people who are so fucking nagging and sad all the time and attention seeking. I mean technically I am attention seeking at this moment because I am searching for replies and reactions from anyone reading this post. And my title was definitely attention grabbing because I can guarantee I caught the attention of many pre-teen girls (or boys (AND many also respectable women and men, who may or may not be mature and knowledgeable too). And no one can really stand them unless they're BSing themselves or are that exact person. But I'm talking people who are depressed in general... 
The thing is, I'm a total fucking hypocrite for this shit. I'm literally diagnosed with depression/anxiety/otber disorders that I don't want to mention because I'm afraid that there are some kids in here who will actually go research it and be like OMG I HAVE THAT TOO and have had my stays in hospitals, self harm, therapists, psychiatrists,  suicide attempts,  etc. Blah blah. Nothing new. But seriously I cannot hear someone talk about sadness and depression without wanting to roll my eyes. I MEAN I KNOW HOW TERRIBLE IM SOUNDING BUT I DO WANT TO WARN YALL THAT I DO NOT EXCERPT THIS ENERGY IN REAL LIFE. I'M VERY EASYGOING AND FRIENDLY IRL. 
I mean I think it might be because I've essentially made myself deal with everything myself. Not literally obviously because I've been in environments with psych professionals, but at this point I'm over it. I'm just sick of it. I'm absolutely sick especially of the people who are so fucking dependent on people and will do shit like get in a relationship to be ""happy"" and then when they break up, fall into some dumbass episode and go through the same cycle over and over. People who are dependent in general annoy me SO MUCH. 
People who nonchalantly bring up their issues too annoy me unless its in a closed environment with a close friend or something. Yeah I slip up because I like making jokes but when I make a joke about neglect or something I regret it immediately and am like ""this is the exact thing you hate,  improve for next time."" I just don't enjoy that type of attention seeking and when I do it impulsively I correct it for as long as I can.
I have a feeling this is because of my lack of a crutch as a kid or something. I mean I totally understand needing to open up but I think there's a time and place, not in front of 2 random people from school.
